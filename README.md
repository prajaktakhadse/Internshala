In this individual project, the task is to develop a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Token) login system in a Spring Boot application. The goal is to implement token-based authentication for securing the API endpoints.Here I implemented a login system using Spring Security, which will generate JWT tokens for authenticated users. These tokens will be used for subsequent API requests to authenticate and authorize access to the patient data.

To interact with the APIs, I used Postman, a popular API testing tool, and Swagger, a tool for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs. Configure these tools to include the JWT token in the headers of the API requests, ensuring secure and token-based authentication.

The patient details will be represented in JSON format, including fields such as name, contact details, address, and pincode. These details will be stored and retrieved from a backend database using the CRUD operations provided by the application.

By the end of this project,  a secure Spring Boot application with Spring Security and JWT authentication, allowing users to perform CRUD operations on patient data while ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the information through token-based authentication.
